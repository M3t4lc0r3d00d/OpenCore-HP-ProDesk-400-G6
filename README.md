# HP-ProDesk-400-G6

OpenCore EFI folder for hackintosh on HP Prodesk 400 G6 SFF with macOS Ventura 13.5.1

Note: I own both the ProDesk 400 G5 and G6 and can verify that they come with the same motherboard. The G5 launched with the 8th gen cpus but received an update, 
and I was able to swap a 9th gen core i3 from my G6 machine into my G5 machine and vice versa. The only visible difference between the 2 devices is that the G5 only
has DisplayPort connectors, whereas the G6 has a HDMI port, making it a little more accessible.

My machines came without Wifi, so I installed a native macOS compatible Broadcom card. There is a dedicated slot on the motherboard for that. I had to add antennas, but
they were very easy to find online.
